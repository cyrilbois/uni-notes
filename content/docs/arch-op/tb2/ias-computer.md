# 2. IAS Computer

[ðŸ”’ Recording](https://github.com/ryanbester/uni-resources/tree/main/arch-op/y1/tb2/2-ias-computer)

## Overview

John von Neumann came up with the stored-program concept, where the instructions are read from part of memory rather than being input manually.

Von Neumann and his colleagues designed a new stored-program computer, knwon as the IAS computer.

The general structure of the IAS computer consists of:

- **Main Memory**: Stores both data and instructions
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit**: Capable of operating on binary data
- **Control Unit**: Interprets the instructions and memory and causes them to be executed
- **Input/Output**: Equipment operated by the control unit

## Memory Structure

The memory of the IAS consists of:

- 1000 storage locations, called words
- Each word is 40 bits each

A word can either be a number word or an instruction word.

## Registers

The ALU contains the following storage locations, called registers:

- **Memory Buffer Register (MBR)**: Contains a word to be stored or retrieved from memory or sent or retrieved from the I/O unit
- **Memory Address Register (MAR)**: Specifies the address in memory of the word to be written or read into the MBR
- **Instruction Register (IR)**: Contains the 8-bit opcode instruction being executed
- **Instruction Buffer Register (IBR)**: Holds temporarily the right-hand instruction from a word in memory
- **Program Counter (PC)**: Contains the address of the next instruction pair to be fetched from memory
- **Accumulator (AC) and Multiplier Quotient (MQ)**: Used to hold temporarily operands and results of ALU operations.
