# 1. Computer Structure and Function

[ðŸ”’ Recording](https://github.com/ryanbester/uni-resources/tree/main/arch-op/y1/tb2/1-computer-structure-function)

## Architecture and Organisation

**Computer Architecture** refers to the attributes that are directly visible to the programmer, and have an impact on the logical execution of a program.

- For example, the instruction set, and the number of bits required to represent various data types.

**Computer Organisation** refers to the operational units and their interconnections that realise the architectural specifications.

- For example, control signals, interfaces between the computer and peripherals, and the memory technology used.

An example is that it is an **architectural** decision whether a computer will have a divide instruction. It is an **organisational** decision whether it'll be implemented in its own division unit or not.

## Structure and Function

**Computer Structure** refers to the way in which the components are interrelated.

**Computer Function** refers to the operation of each individual component as part of the structure. 

### Structure

There are four main structural components:

- Central processing unit (CPU)
- Main memory
- I/O
- System interconnection

The CPU contains the following sub-components:

- Control unit
- Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)
- Registers
- CPU interconnection

The control unit contains the following sub-components:

- Sequencing logic
- Control unit registers and decoders
- Control memory

### Function

A computer can perform four basic functions:

- Data processing
- Data storage
- Data movement
- Data control
