# 5. Computer Memory Systems

[ðŸ”’ Recording](https://github.com/ryanbester/uni-resources/tree/main/arch-op/y1/tb2/5-computer-memory-systems)

## Memory

Computer Memory is where the computer stores or remembers data (in binary).

Memory stores information temporarily or permanently and provides the CPU with its instructions.

## Key Characteristics

- **Location**:
    - Internal (e.g. processor registers, main memory, cache)
    - External (e.g. optical disks, magnetic disks, tapes)
- **Capacity**:
    - Number of words
    - Number of bytes
- **Unit of Transfer** (the number of bits read out of or written into memory at a time):
    - Bits (main mnemory)
    - Word
    - Block
- **Access Method**:
    - Sequential access (linear sequence) - Tape units
    - Direct access - Disk units
    - Random access - Main memory, Cache systems
    - Associative access - Cache systems
- **Performance**:
    - Access time (latency)
    - Cycle time
    - Transfer rate (1/cycle time)
- **Physical Type**:
    - Semiconductor
    - Magnetic
    - Optical
    - Magneto-optical
- **Physical Characteristics**:
    - Volatile/non-volatile
    - Erasable/non-erasable

## Memory Hierarchy

- Greater Capacity -> Lower Cost per unit
- Greater Capacity -> Slower Access Time
- Faster Access Time -> Greater Cost

As the level goes down:

- Decreasing cost per bit
- Increasing capacity
- Increasing access time
- Decreasing frequency of access of the memory by processor

## Cache Memory

- Concept:
    - Combine fast and expensive memory with less expensive and lower speed
- Cache contains a copy of portions of memory
- Multiple levels of cache organisation
